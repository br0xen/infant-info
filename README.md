infant-info
========
A website for compiling Wichita resources in an attempt to decrease the infant mortality rate.

Kansas' infant mortality rate is higher than the average for the rest of the country.
In part, this is due to a lack of knowledge about what resources are available.

The goal of this website is to be a central repository for that info that nurses, midwives, and anyone else can use to find the resources that they need to help.
